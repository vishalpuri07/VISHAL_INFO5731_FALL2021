Different websites such as John Hopkins University's Covid data, Our World in Data's website, etc. can provide necessary dataset for this step. Create a dataset that contains information on name of counties and if the mask mandate is in place or not. Record the state as well.\n",

The next step is to collect the data to see if the Covid Cases on those counties are rising or not after the mask manate is on place or vice-versa. Be sure to state all assumptions at this point. These two are the main dataset required to answer the research question.\n",
        "3. Initiate randomness in process meaning what are the odds that Covid-Cases would rise or fall for a given county regardless of mask mandate. Lets say 35% of the time Covid Cases would tend to rise based on Histogram of the data irrespective of the Mask mandate. What percent of counties are seeing rising cases due to mask mandate in/ not in place.\n",

Since, there are only 3006 counties in United States and data for all counties might not be available, it is important to collect as much data as possible.
