              "\"0 no movement , no yuks , not much of anything .\\n0 a gob of drivel so sickly sweet , even the eager consumers of moore 's pasteurized ditties will retch it up like rancid crème brûlée .\\n0 gangs of new york is an unapologetic mess , whose only saving grace is that it ends by blowing just about everything up .\\n0 we never really feel involved with the story , as all of its ideas remain just that : abstract ideas .\\n1 this is one of polanski 's best films .\\n1 take care of my cat offers a refreshingly different slice of asian cinema .\\n0 acting , particularly by tambor , almost makes `` never again '' worthwhile , but -lrb- writer\\\\/director -rrb- schaeffer should follow his titular advice\\n1 the movie exists for its soccer action and its fine acting .\\n0 arnold 's jump from little screen to big will leave frowns on more than a few faces .\\n0 if this holiday movie is supposed to be a gift , somebody unwrapped it early , took out all the good stuff , and left behind the crap -lrb- literally -rrb- .\\n1 jason x has cheesy effects and a hoary plot , but its macabre , self-deprecating sense of humor makes up for a lot .\\n0 even as lame horror flicks go , this is lame .\\n0 oft-described as the antidote to american pie-type sex comedies , it actually has a bundle in common with them , as the film diffuses every opportunity for a breakthrough\\n1 though the violence is far less sadistic than usual , the film is typical miike : fast , furious and full of off-the-cuff imaginative flourishes .\\n0 when a set of pre-shooting guidelines a director came up with for his actors turns out to be cleverer , better written and of considerable more interest than the finished film , that 's a bad sign .\\n1 the passions aroused by the discord between old and new cultures are set against the strange , stark beauty of the mideast desert , so lovingly and perceptively filmed that you can almost taste the desiccated air .\\n1 if your senses have n't been dulled by slasher films and gorefests , if you 're a connoisseur of psychological horror , this is your ticket .\\n0 any one episode of the sopranos would send this ill-conceived folly to sleep with the fishes .\\n0 as conceived by mr. schaeffer , christopher and grace are little more than collections of quirky traits lifted from a screenwriter 's outline and thrown at actors charged with the impossible task of making them jell .\\n0 those who managed to avoid the deconstructionist theorizing of french philosopher jacques derrida in college can now take an 85-minute brush-up course with the documentary derrida .\\n1 most new movies have a bright sheen .\\n0 but what saves lives on the freeway does not necessarily make for persuasive viewing .\\n1 steve irwin 's method is ernest hemmingway at accelerated speed and volume .\\n1 nicely serves as an examination of a society in transition .\\n0 the film would work much better as a video installation in a museum , where viewers would be free to leave .\\n0 culkin exudes none of the charm or charisma that might keep a more general audience even vaguely interested in his bratty character .\\n0 the whole thing plays out with the drowsy heaviness of synchronized swimmer wearing a wool wetsuit .\\n1 not a cozy or ingratiating work , but it 's challenging , sometimes clever , and always interesting , and those are reasons enough to see it .\\n0 the premise for this kegger comedy probably sounded brilliant four six-packs and a pitcher of margaritas in , but the film must have been written ... in the thrall of a vicious hangover .\\n1 it 's a pleasure to see seinfeld griping about the biz with buddies chris rock , garry shandling and colin quinn .\\n1 finally , a genre movie that delivers -- in a couple of genres , no less .\\n0 the low-budget full frontal was one of the year 's murkiest , intentionally obscure and self-indulgent pictures , and solaris is its big-budget brother .\\n1 exquisitely acted and masterfully if preciously interwoven ... -lrb- the film -rrb- addresses in a fascinating , intelligent manner the intermingling of race , politics and local commerce .\\n1 an enthralling , playful film that constantly frustrates our desire to know the ` truth ' about this man , while deconstructing the very format of the biography in a manner that derrida would doubtless give his blessing to .\\n1 as a singular character study , it 's perfect .\\n1 haneke challenges us to confront the reality of sexual aberration .\\n1 an experience so engrossing it is like being buried in a new environment .\\n1 all the performances are top notch and , once you get through the accents , all or nothing becomes an emotional , though still positive , wrench of a sit .\\n1 a cockamamie tone poem pitched precipitously between swoony lyricism and violent catastrophe ... the most aggressively nerve-wracking and screamingly neurotic romantic comedy in cinema history .\\n0 i do n't have an i am sam clue .\\n1 zhang yimou delivers warm , genuine characters who lie not through dishonesty , but because they genuinely believe it 's the only way to bring happiness to their loved ones .\\n1 the pleasures of super troopers may be fleeting , but they 'll register strongly with anybody who still retains a soft spot for precollegiate humor .\\n0 the thrill is -lrb- long -rrb- gone .\\n1 much monkeyfun for all .\\n0 a dreary , incoherent , self-indulgent mess of a movie in which a bunch of pompous windbags drone on inanely for two hours ... a cacophony of pretentious , meaningless prattle .\\n1 much of the way , though , this is a refreshingly novel ride .\\n1 for the first time in several years , mr. allen has surpassed himself with the magic he 's spun with the hollywood empress of ms. leoni 's ellie .\\n1 one scarcely needs the subtitles to enjoy this colorful action farce .\\n0 as it abruptly crosscuts among the five friends , it fails to lend the characters ' individual stories enough dramatic resonance to make us care about them .\\n1 what might have been a predictably heartwarming tale is suffused with complexity .\\n0 with generic sets and b-grade special effects , jason is about as convincing on the sci-fi front as tv 's defunct cleopatra 2525 .\\n1 this is simply the most fun you 'll ever have with a documentary !\\n1 it represents better-than-average movie-making that does n't demand a dumb , distracted audience .\\n0 ... the sum of the parts equals largely a confused mediocrity .\\n0 it may be an easy swipe to take , but this barbershop just does n't make the cut .\\n1 the fact that the rookie is a nearly impeccable cinematic experience -- and a wonderful all-ages triumph besides -- is a miracle akin to the story the film portrays .\\n0 how on earth , or anywhere else , did director ron underwood manage to blow $ 100 million on this ?\\n1 for all its failed connections , divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood is nurturing , in a gauzy , dithering way .\\n0 as are its star , its attitude and its obliviousness .\\n0 sluggishly directed by episodic tv veteran joe zwick , it 's a sitcom without the snap-crackle .\\n1 a dream cast of solid female talent who build a seamless ensemble .\\n0 the plot is straight off the shelf , the performances are television - caliber and the message of providing solace through deception is a little creepy .\\n0 instead of accurately accounting a terrible true story , the film 's more determined to become the next texas chainsaw massacre .\\n1 the movie is well shot and very tragic , and one to ponder after the credits roll .\\n1 it is ridiculous , of course ... but it is also refreshing , disarming , and just outright enjoyable despite its ridiculousness .\\n1 everything you loved about it

something even quasi-original , when you can pillage from shirley jackson , richard matheson ... and puke up something like rose red ?\\n1 an absorbing trip into the minds and motivations of people under stress as well as a keen , unsentimental look at variations on the theme of motherhood .\\n1 though a bit of a patchwork in script and production , a glossy , rich green , environment almost

undercover brother is definitely one for the masses , it 's also full of sharp , smart satire .\\n1 visits spy-movie territory like a novel you ca n't put down , examines a footnote to history seldom brought to light on the screen , and keeps you guessing from first frame to last .\\n1 it suggests the wide-ranging effects of media manipulation , from the kind of reporting that is done by the supposedly liberal media ... to the intimate and ultimately tragic heartache of maverick individuals like hatfield and hicks .\\n1 this warm and gentle romantic comedy has enough interesting characters to fill several movies , and its ample charms should win over the most hard-hearted cynics .\\n0 half of it is composed of snappy patter and pseudo-sophisticated cultural observations , while the remainder ... would be more at home on a daytime television serial .\\n0 though howard demonstrates a great eye as a director , this southern gothic drama is sadly a tough sit , with an undeveloped narrative and enough flashbacks and heavy-handed metaphors to choke a horse -- or at least slow him down to a canter .\\n1 a tough go , but leigh 's depth and rigor , and his skill at inspiring accomplished portrayals that are all the more impressive for their lack of showiness , offsets to a notable degree the film 's often-mined and despairing milieu .\\n0 at first , the sight of a blind man directing a film is hilarious , but as the film goes on , the joke wears thin .\\n1 a charming romantic comedy that is by far the lightest dogme film and among the most enjoyable .\\n1

have considerable personal charm , and their screen rapport makes the old story seem new .\\n1 the reason this picture works better than its predecessors is that myers is no longer simply spoofing the mini-mod-madness of '60s spy movies .\\n0 he has not learnt that storytelling is what the movies are about .\\n1 an intelligent , earnest , intimate film that drops the ball only when it pauses for blunt exposition to make sure you 're getting its metaphysical point .\\n1 majidi 's poetic love story is a ravishing consciousness-raiser , if a bit draggy at times .\\n1 westfeldt and juergensen

mesmerizing -- filled with menace and squalor .\\n1 do n't plan on the perfect ending , but sweet home alabama hits the mark with critics who escaped from a small town life .\\n1 a stunning piece of visual poetry that will , hopefully , be remembered as one of the most important stories to be told in australia 's film history .\\n0 too timid to bring a sense of closure to an ugly chapter of the twentieth century .\\n0 plays less like a coming-of-age romance than an infomercial .\\n0 all that -lrb- powerpuff girls -rrb- charm is present in the movie , but it 's spread too thin .\\n1 jirí hubac 's script is a gem .\\n0 as -lrb- the characters -rrb- get more depressed , the story gets more tiresome , especially as it continues to mount a conspicuous effort to be profound .\\n1 even when foreign directors ... borrow stuff from hollywood , they invariably shake up the formula and make it more interesting .\\n0 feels like six different movies fighting each other for attention .\\n1 this bold and lyrical first feature from raja amari expands the pat notion that middle-aged women just wanna have fun into a rousing treatise of sensual empowerment .\\n1 often gruelling and heartbreaking to witness , but seldahl and wollter 's sterling performances raise this far above the level of the usual maudlin disease movie .\\n0 a mix of velocity and idiocy , this ruinous remake lacks the brawn -- and the brains -- of the 1970s original .\\n1 cantet perfectly captures the hotel lobbies , two-lane highways , and roadside cafes that permeate vincent 's days\\n0 friday after next has the same problem that next friday did -- it 's called where 's chris tucker when you need him ?\\n0 extremely confusing .\\n0 well-intentioned though it may be , its soap-opera morality tales have the antiseptic , preprogrammed feel of an after-school special .\\n1 but fans should have fun meeting a brand-new pokemon called celebi .\\n0 son of the bride may be a good half-hour too long but comes replete with a flattering sense of mystery and quietness .\\n0 it 's laughing at us .\\n0 like most sequels , it takes what worked last time , repeats it and adds more characters , more stunts , more stuff in attempt to camouflage its sameness .\\n0 this film 's relationship to actual tension is the same as what christmas-tree flocking in a spray can is to actual snow : a poor -- if durable -- imitation .\\n0 helmer devito ... attempts to do too many things in this story about ethics , payola , vice , murder , kids ' tv and revenge .\\n0 the humor is hinged on the belief that knees in the crotch , elbows in the face and spit in the eye are inherently funny .\\n1 4 friends , 2 couples , 2000 miles , and all the pabst blue ribbon beer they can drink - it 's the ultimate redneck road-trip .\\n0 still , i 'm not quite sure what the point is ...\\n0 has it ever been possible to say that williams has truly inhabited a character ?\\n0 after that , it just gets stupid and maudlin .\\n0 unfortunately , heartbreak hospital wants to convey the same kind of haughtiness in its own sketchy material but this territory has already been explored previously with better aplomb and sardonic wit .\\n1 by the end of no such thing the audience , like beatrice , has a watchful affection for the monster .\\n0 a baffling misfire , and possibly the weakest movie -lrb- woody allen -rrb- has made in the last twenty years .\\n1 the production values are up there .\\n0 rates an ` e ' for effort -- and a ` b ' for boring .\\n1 the pianist is a fine valedictory work for polanski , made richer by his own experiences , making his other movies somehow richer in the bargain .\\n0 being author wells ' great-grandson , you 'd think filmmaker simon wells would have more reverence for the material .\\n0 a modest and messy metaphysical thriller offering more questions than answers .\\n1 it 's the best film of the year so far , the benchmark against which all other best picture contenders should be measured .\\n1 smith 's approach is never to tease , except gently and in that way that makes us consider our own eccentricities and how they are expressed through our homes .\\n0 a shambles of a movie -- visually unattractive , unbearably loud and utterly silly ... its hilarity is completely unintentional .\\n1 its direction , its script , and weaver 's performance as a vaguely discontented woman of substance make for a mildly entertaining 77 minutes , if that 's what you 're in the mood for .\\n1 it is so refreshing to see robin williams turn 180 degrees from the string of insultingly innocuous and sappy fiascoes he 's been making for the last several years .\\n0 `` collateral damage '' goes by the numbers and reps decent action entertainment -- until the silly showdown ending that forces the viewer to totally suspend disbelief\\n0 still , this thing feels flimsy and ephemeral .\\n1 a blessed gift to film geeks and historians .\\n1 what jackson has accomplished here is amazing on a technical level .\\n1 it should be mentioned that the set design and interiors of the haunted vessel are more than effectively creepy and moodily lit .\\n1 there 's no denying the physically spectacular qualities of the film ... or the emotional integrity of the performances .\\n1 whether you 're moved and love it , or bored or frustrated by the film , you 'll still feel something .\\n1 a psychologically rich and suspenseful moral thriller with a stellar performance by al pacino .\\n1 an absorbing , slice-of-depression life that touches nerves and rings true .\\n0 moderately involving despite bargain-basement photography and hackneyed romance .\\n1 this is a film well worth seeing , talking and singing heads and all .\\n0 what was subtle and mystifying in the novella is now broad and farcical .\\n0 the plot is so predictable and sentimental that viewers are likely to lose interest before sandrine and her goats walk off into the sunset .\\n1 roger michell , who did an appealing

this .\\n1 ... there are enough moments of heartbreaking honesty to keep one glued to the screen .\\n1 i loved it !\\n1 brilliant ! '\\n0 some studio pizazz might have helped .\\n0 it will come as no surprise that the movie is n't scary .\\n0 all the well-meaningness in the world ca n't erase the fact that the believer feels like a 12-step program for the jewish nazi .\\n0 a grim , flat and boring werewolf movie that refuses to develop an energy level .\\n0 a hideous , confusing spectacle , one that may well put the nail in the coffin of any future rice adaptations .\\n0 as tweedy talks about canning his stockbroker and repairing his pool , you yearn for a few airborne tv sets or nude groupies on the nod to liven things up .\\n1 cedar takes a very open-minded approach to this sensitive material , showing impressive control , both visually and in the writing .\\n0 you can practically smell the patchouli oil .\\n1 cute , funny , heartwarming digitally animated feature film with plenty of slapstick humor for the kids , lots of in-jokes for the adults and heart enough for everyone .\\n1 what full frontal lacks in thematic coherence it largely makes up for as loosey-goosey , experimental entertainment .\\n0 mark me down as a non-believer in werewolf films that are not serious and rely on stupidity as a substitute for humor .\\n1 maguire is a surprisingly effective peter\\\\/spider-man .\\n1 windtalkers is shapelessly gratifying , the kind of movie that invites you to pick apart its faults even as you have to admit that somehow it hit you where you live .\\n1 for its seriousness , high literary aspirations and stunning acting , the film can only be applauded .\\n0 so clichéd that , at one point , they literally upset an apple cart .\\n1 a byzantine melodrama that stimulates the higher brain functions as well as the libido .\\n1 cho 's fearless in picking apart human foibles , not afraid to lay her life bare in front of an audience .\\n1 about nowhere kids who appropriated turfs as they found them and become self-made celebrity athletes -- a low-down version of the american dream .\\n0 ... an unimaginative , nasty , glibly cynical piece of work .\\n1 ... in this incarnation its fizz is infectious .\\n0 it 's just incredibly dull .\\n1 genuinely touching because it 's realistic about all kinds of love .\\n1 nicolas philibert observes life inside a one-room schoolhouse in northern france in his documentary to be and to have , easily one of the best films of the year .\\n1 it 's rare to find a film that dazzles the eye , challenges the brain , and satisfies our lust for fast-paced action , but minority report delivers all that and a whole lot more .\\n1 a charming , quirky and leisurely paced scottish comedy -- except with an outrageous central gimmick that could have been a reject from monty python 's meaning of life .\\n1 a graceful , contemplative film that gradually and artfully draws us into a world where the personal and the political get fatally intertwined .\\n0 what will , most likely , turn out to be the most repellent movie of 2002 .\\n0 a little too pat for its own good .\\n0 the story is familiar from its many predecessors ; like them , it eventually culminates in the not-exactly - stunning insight that crime does n't pay .\\n0 even legends like alfred hitchcock and john huston occasionally directed trifles ... so it 's no surprise to see a world-class filmmaker like zhang yimou behind the camera for a yarn that 's ultimately rather inconsequential .\\n1 if nothing else , this movie introduces a promising , unusual kind of psychological horror .\\n0 a sermonizing and lifeless paean to teenage dullards .\\n0 for all its highfalutin title and corkscrew narrative , the movie turns out to be not much more than a shaggy human tale .\\n0 had anyone here done anything remotely intelligent , we all could have stopped watching long ago .\\n1 a teasing drama whose relentless good-deed\\\\/bad-deed reversals are just interesting enough to make a sinner like me pray for an even more interesting , less symmetrical , less obviously cross-shaped creation .\\n0 there is not a character in the movie with a shred of plausibility , not an event that is believable , not a confrontation that is not staged , not a moment that is not false .\\n0 bad company leaves a bad taste , not only because of its bad-luck timing , but also the staleness of its script .\\n0 mckay deflates his piece of puffery with a sour cliche and heavy doses of mean-spiritedness\\n0 ethan hawke has always fancied himself the bastard child of the beatnik generation and it 's all over his chelsea walls .\\n0 the film might have been more satisfying if it had , in fact , been fleshed out a little more instead of going for easy smiles .\\n1 an unbelievably fun film just a leading man away from perfection .\\n0 extremely dumb .\\n0 flotsam in the sea of moviemaking , not big enough for us to worry about it causing significant harm and not smelly enough to bother despising .\\n0 cliches are as thick as the cigarette smoke .\\n0 leave these flowers unpicked -- they 're dead on the vine .\\n0 when the plot kicks in , the film loses credibility .\\n1 may be spoofing an easy target -- those old ' 50 's giant creature features -- but ... it acknowledges and celebrates their cheesiness as the reason why people get a kick out of watching them today .\\n0 the unceasing sadism is so graphically excessive , the director just ends up exposing his own obsession .\\n0 imagine the james woods character from videodrome making a home movie of audrey rose and showing it to the kid from the sixth sense and you 've imagined the ring .\\n0 this film was made to get laughs from the slowest person in the audience -- just pure slapstick with lots of inane , inoffensive screaming and exaggerated facial expressions .\\n0 it 's so underwritten that you ca n't figure out just where the other characters , including ana 's father and grandfather , come down on the issue of ana 's future .\\n1 think of it as a sort of comfort food for the mind .\\n1 hilarious , acidic brit comedy .\\n1 an incredibly clever and superbly paced caper filled with scams within scams within scams .\\n0 myers never knows when to let a gag die ; thus , we 're subjected to one mind-numbingly lengthy riff on poo and pee jokes after another .\\n1 but watching huppert , a great actress tearing into a landmark role , is riveting .\\n1 a marvellous journey from childhood idealism to adolescent self-absorption .\\n1 whether seen on a 10-inch television screen or at your local multiplex , the edge-of-your-seat , educational antics of steve irwin are priceless entertainment .\\n0 how did it ever get made ?\\n1 it is also , at times , curiously moving .\\n1 it is inspirational in characterizing how people from such diverse cultures share the same human and spiritual needs .\\n1 a candid and often fascinating documentary about a pentecostal church in dallas that assembles an elaborate haunted house each year to scare teenagers into attending services .\\n1 the invincible werner herzog is alive and well and living in la\\n1 worth the effort to watch .\\n1 everything that has to do with yvan and charlotte , and everything that has to do with yvan 's rambunctious , jewish sister and her non-jew husband , feels funny and true .\\n1 grant gets to display his cadness to perfection , but also to show acting range that may surprise some who thought light-hearted comedy was his forte .\\n0 just a bloody mess .\\n0 suffers from rambling , repetitive dialogue and the visual drabness endemic to digital video .\\n1 the film is often filled with a sense of pure wonderment and excitement not often seen in today 's cinema du sarcasm\\n1 i do n't think i 've been as entranced and appalled by an asian film since shinya tsukamoto 's iron man .\\n1 the powers team has fashioned a comedy with more laughs than many , no question .\\n1 anchored by a terrific performance by abbass , satin rouge shows that the idea of women 's self-actualization knows few continental divides .\\n1 kaufman creates an eerie sense of not only being there at the time of these events but the very night matthew was killed .\\n0 as an actor , the rock is aptly named .\\n1 thoughtful , provocative and entertaining .\\n0 scene-by-scene , things happen , but you 'd be hard-pressed to say what or why .\\n0 at nearly three hours , the whole of safe conduct is less than the sum of its parts .\\n0 dawdles and drags when it should pop ; it does n't even have the virtue of enough mindless violence to break up the tedium of all its generational bonding .\\n0 places a slightly believable love triangle in a difficult-to-swallow setting , and then disappointingly moves the story into the realm of an improbable thriller .\\n0 trivial where it should be profound , and hyper-cliched where it should be sincere .\\n1 there 's not much more to this adaptation of the nick hornby novel than charm -- effortless , pleasurable , featherweight charm .\\n0 good for a few unintentional laughs , `` extreme ops '' was obviously made for the `` xxx '' crowd , people who enjoy mindless action without the benefit of decent acting , writing , and direction .\\n1 tim story 's not there yet - but ` barbershop ' shows he 's on his way .\\n1 a sports movie with action that 's exciting on the field and a story you care about off it .\\n1 those outside show business will enjoy a close look at people they do n't really want to know .\\n1 the values that have held the enterprise crew together through previous adventures and perils do so again-courage , self-sacrifice and patience under pressure .\\n0 what happened with pluto nash ?\\n0 notorious c.h.o. has oodles of vulgar highlights .\\n0 before long , the film starts playing like general hospital crossed with a saturday night live spoof of dog day afternoon .\\n0 it 's just a silly black genre spoof .\\n0 as written by michael berg and michael j. wilson from a story by wilson , this relentless , all-wise-guys-all-the-time approach tries way too hard and gets tiring in no time at all .\\n1 in fessenden 's horror trilogy , this theme has proved important to him and is especially so in the finale .\\n0 splashes its drama all over the screen , subjecting its audience and characters to action that feels not only manufactured , but also so false you can see the filmmakers ' puppet strings .\\n1 offers that rare combination of entertainment and education .\\n1 romanek keeps the film constantly taut ... reflecting the character 's instability with a metaphorical visual style and an unnerving , heartbeat-like score .\\n1 despite the long running time , the pace never feels slack -- there 's no scene that screams `` bathroom break ! ''\\n1 greene delivers a typically solid performance in a role that is a bit of a departure from the noble characters he has played in the past , and he is matched by schweig , who carries the film on his broad , handsome shoulders .\\n1 moore 's complex and important film is also , believe it or not , immensely entertaining , a david and goliath story that 's still very much playing itself out .\\n0 there 's no denying the elaborateness of the artist 's conceptions , nor his ability to depict them with outrageous elan , but really the whole series is so much pretentious nonsense , lavishly praised by those who equate obscurity with profundity .\\n1 as a belated nod to some neglected all-stars , standing in the shadows of motown is cultural history of the best kind : informative , revealing and richly entertaining .\\n1 engagingly captures the maddening and magnetic ebb and flow of friendship .\\n1 eventually , it wins you over .\\n1 you 'll be left with the sensation of having just witnessed a great performance and , perhaps , give in to the urge to get on your feet and shake it .\\n0 if we do n't demand a standard of quality for the art that we choose , we deserve the trash that we get .\\n1 the acting alone is worth the price of admission .\\n1 i admired this work a lot .\\n0 might have been better off as a documentary , with less of mr. eyre 's uninspired dramatics and more of his sense of observation and outrage .\\n0 it tries too hard , and overreaches the logic of its own world .\\n1 highlights are the terrific performances by christopher plummer , as the prime villain , and nathan lane as vincent crummles , the eccentric theater company manager .\\n1 bullock does a good job here of working against her natural likability .\\n1 the 3d images only enhance the film 's otherworldly quality , giving it a strange combo of you-are-there closeness with the disorienting unreality of the seemingly broken-down fourth wall of the movie screen .\\n1 this version 's no classic like its predecessor , but its pleasures are still plentiful .\\n0 it 's neither as romantic nor as thrilling as it should be .\\n0 if this is the danish idea of a good time , prospective tourists might want to consider a different destination -- some jolly country embroiled in a bloody civil war , perhaps .\\n1 but some unexpected zigs and zags help .\\n1 we can see the wheels turning , and we might resent it sometimes , but this is still a nice little picture , made by bright and friendly souls with a lot of good cheer .\\n1 it is not a mass-market entertainment but an uncompromising attempt by one artist to think about another .\\n1 an irresistible combination of a rousing good story set on a truly grand scale .\\n1 de niro and mcdormand give solid performances , but their screen time is sabotaged by the story 's inability to create interest .\\n0 the master of disaster - it 's a piece of dreck disguised as comedy .\\n1 as weber and weissman demonstrate with such insight and celebratory verve , the cockettes were n't as much about gender , sexual preference or political agitprop as they were simply a triumph of the indomitable human will to rebel , connect and create .\\n1 a psychological thriller with a smart script and an obsessive-compulsive 's attention to detail .\\n1 interacting eyeball-to-eyeball and toe-to-toe , hopkins and norton are a winning combination -- but fiennes steals ` red dragon ' right from under their noses .\\n0 what could and should have been biting and droll is instead a tepid waste of time and talent .\\n0 if you think that jennifer lopez has shown poor judgment in planning to marry ben affleck , wait till you see maid in manhattan .\\n1 a map of the inner rhythms of love and jealousy and sacrifice drawn with a master 's steady stroke .\\n1 there is n't a weak or careless performance amongst them .\\n1 the perfect film for those who like sick comedies that can be snide .\\n0 it virtually defines a comedy that 's strongly mediocre , with funny bits surfacing every once in a while .\\n1 the film benefits greatly from a less manic tone than its predecessor , as cho appears to have settled comfortably into her skin .\\n1 fans of nijinsky will savor every minute of cox 's work .\\n1 novak manages to capture a cruelly hilarious vein of black comedy in the situation with his cast of non-actors and a gritty , no-budget approach .\\n1 what really surprises about wisegirls is its low-key quality and genuine tenderness .\\n1 i enjoyed the ride -lrb- bumps and all -rrb- , creamy depth , and ultimate theme .\\n0 what you get with empire is a movie you 've seen many times before , repackaged as new material because there is a latino in the lead .\\n0 a very average science fiction film .\\n0 it 's a great deal of sizzle and very little steak .\\n0 the film is like a series of beginnings and middles that never take off .\\n0 verbinski substitutes atmosphere for action , tedium for thrills .\\n0 no reason for anyone to invest their hard-earned bucks into a movie which obviously did n't invest much into itself either .\\n0 the charms of willful eccentricity , at least as evidenced by this latest cinematic essay , are beginning to wear a bit thin .\\n0 though everything might be literate and smart , it never took off and always seemed static .\\n0 we miss the quirky amazement that used to come along for an integral part of the ride .\\n1 complex , affecting and uniquely almodóvar , the film evokes strong emotions and pushes viewers to question their deepest notions of moral right and wrong .\\n1 a savvy exploration of paranoia and insecurity in america 's culture of fear .\\n0 while the mystery surrounding the nature of the boat 's malediction remains intriguing enough to sustain mild interest , the picture refuses to offer much accompanying sustenance in the way of characterization , humor or plain old popcorn fun .\\n1 theirs is a simple and heart-warming story , full of mirth that should charm all but the most cynical .\\n0 cho 's fans are sure to be entertained ; it 's only fair in the interest of full disclosure to say that -- on the basis of this film alone -- i 'm not one of them .\\n1 while it would be easy to give crush the new title of two weddings and a funeral , it 's a far more thoughtful film than any slice of hugh grant whimsy .\\n0 while benigni -lrb- who stars and co-wrote -rrb- seems to be having a wonderful time , he might be alone in that .\\n1 smith 's point is simple and obvious -- people 's homes are extensions of themselves , and particularly eccentric people have particularly eccentric living spaces -- but his subjects are charmers .\\n0 divertingly ridiculous , headbangingly noisy .\\n0 extremely boring .\\n1 an impossible romance , but we root for the patronized iranian lad .\\n0 i doubt anyone will remember the picture by the time christmas really rolls around , but maybe it 'll be on video by then .\\n1 eight crazy nights is a showcase for sandler 's many talents .\\n0 too lazy to take advantage of its semi-humorous premise .\\n1 if there 's a way to effectively teach kids about the dangers of drugs , i think it 's in projects like the -lrb- unfortunately r-rated -rrb- paid .\\n0 you 'll be more entertained getting hit by a bus .\\n1 an enjoyable film for the family , amusing and cute for both adults and kids .\\n1 it 's a glorious groove that leaves you wanting more .\\n0 there are touching moments in etoiles , but for the most part this is a dull , dour documentary on what ought to be a joyful or at least fascinating subject .\\n1 more honest about alzheimer 's disease , i think , than iris .\\n0 what 's at stake in this film is nothing more than an obsolete , if irritating , notion of class .\\n0 offensive in the way it exploits the hot-button issue of domestic abuse for cheap thrills and disgusting in the manner it repeatedly puts a small child in jeopardy , treating her as little more than a prop to be cruelly tormented .\\n1 some movies are like a tasty hors-d'oeuvre ; this one is a feast .\\n0 it would n't be my preferred way of spending 100 minutes or $ 7.00 .\\n1 you might not want to hang out with samantha , but you 'll probably see a bit of yourself in her unfinished story .\\n0 a monster combat thriller as impersonal in its relentlessness as the videogame series that inspired it .\\n1 effectively feeds our senses with the chilling sights and sounds from within the camp to create a completely numbing experience .\\n0 life is a crock -- or something like it .\\n1 a richly imagined and admirably mature work from a gifted director who definitely has something on his mind .\\n1 from spiritual rebirth to bruising defeat , vincent 's odyssey resonates in a profound way , comparable to the classic films of jean renoir .\\n1 is n't quite the equal of woo 's best earlier work , but it 's easily his finest american film ... comes close to recapturing the brilliance of his hong kong films .\\n0 the weight of water uses water as a metaphor for subconscious desire , but this leaky script barely stays afloat .\\n0 automatically pegs itself for the straight-to-video sci-fi rental shelf .\\n0 one minute , you think you 're watching a serious actioner ; the next , it 's as though clips from the pink panther strikes again and\\\\/or sailor moon have been spliced in .\\n1 director benoit jacquot , making his first opera-to-film translation with tosca , conveys the heaving passion of puccini 's famous love-jealousy - murder-suicide fandango with great cinematic innovation .\\n0 a boring , wincingly cute and nauseatingly politically correct cartoon guaranteed to drive anyone much over age 4 screaming from the theater .\\n0 never quite transcends jokester status ... and the punchline does n't live up to barry 's dead-eyed , perfectly chilled delivery .\\n0 choppy editing and too many repetitive scenes spoil what could have been an important documentary about stand-up comedy .\\n1 makes an aborbing if arguable case for the man 's greatness .\\n0 an unsatisfying hybrid of blair witch and typical stalk-and-slash fare , where the most conservative protagonist is always the last one living .\\n1 the diversity of the artists represented , both in terms of style and ethnicity , prevents the proceedings from feeling repetitious , as does the appropriately brief 40-minute running time .\\n0 unfortunately , they 're sandwiched in between the most impossibly dry account of kahlo 's life imaginable .\\n0 this extremely unfunny film clocks in at 80 minutes , but feels twice as long .\\n1 it 's like a poem .\\n0 a strong first quarter , slightly less so second quarter , and average second half .\\n0 earnest but earthbound ... a slow , soggy , soporific , visually dank crime melodrama\\\\/character study that would be more at home on the small screen but for its stellar cast .\\n0 it 's as flat as an open can of pop left sitting in the sun .\\n0 a movie far more cynical and lazy than anything a fictitious charlie kaufman might object to .\\n0 a sour , nasty offering .\\n0 everyone connected to this movie seems to be part of an insider clique , which tends to breed formulaic films rather than fresh ones .\\n0 this time kaufman 's imagination has failed him .\\n1 ... breathes surprising new life into the familiar by amalgamating genres and adding true human complexity to its not-so-stock characters . '\\n0 suggests puns about ingredients and soup and somebody being off their noodle , but let 's just say the ingredients do n't quite add up to a meal .\\n1 the movie has an avalanche of eye-popping visual effects .\\n0 this is junk food cinema at its greasiest .\\n1 clever , brutal and strangely soulful movie .\\n0 -lrb- director -rrb- byler may yet have a great movie in him , but charlotte sometimes is only half of one .\\n1 if you liked the 1982 film then , you 'll still like it now .\\n1 a miniscule little bleep on the film radar , but one that many more people should check out\\n0 shamelessly sappy and , worse , runs away from its own provocative theme .\\n1 choose your reaction : a. -rrb- that sure is funny !\\n0 it 's the kind of movie that ends up festooning u.s. art house screens for no reason other than the fact that it 's in french -lrb- well , mostly -rrb- with english subtitles and is magically ` significant ' because of that .\\n1 droll caper-comedy remake of `` big deal on madonna street '' that 's a sly , amusing , laugh-filled little gem in which the ultimate `` bellini '' begins to look like a `` real kaputschnik . ''\\n1 call me a wimp , but i cried , not once , but three times in this animated sweet film .\\n1 japan 's premier stylist of sex and blood hits audiences with what may be his most demented film to date .\\n1 and if the hours wins ` best picture ' i just might .\\n0 another rent installment for the ian fleming estate .\\n0 instead of kicking off the intrigue and suspense and mystery of the whole thing , hart 's war , like the st. louis rams in the super bowl , waits until after halftime to get started .\\n1 murderous maids may well be the most comprehensive of these films and also strike closest to the truth .\\n0 some of seagal 's action pictures are guilty pleasures , but this one is so formulaic that it seems to be on auto-pilot .\\n1 one of the greatest family-oriented , fantasy-adventure movies ever .\\n0 for caine lovers only .\\n0 a trashy , exploitative , thoroughly unpleasant experience .\\n0 opens at a funeral , ends on the protagonist 's death bed and does n't get much livelier in the three hours in between .\\n0 ... surprisingly inert for a movie in which the main character travels back and forth between epochs .\\n1 thrilling , provocative and darkly funny , this timely sci-fi mystery works on so many different levels that it not only invites , it demands repeated viewings .\\n1 farrell ... thankfully manages to outshine the role and successfully plays the foil to willis 's world-weary colonel .\\n1 that zhang would make such a strainingly cute film -- with a blind orphan at its center , no less -- indicates where his ambitions have wandered .\\n1 those who would follow haneke on his creepy explorations ... are rewarded by brutal , committed performances from huppert and magimel .\\n0 but it pays a price for its intricate intellectual gamesmanship .\\n1 a fascinating and fun film .\\n1 the use of cgi and digital ink-and-paint make the thing look really slick .\\n1 a sad , superior human comedy played out on the back roads of life .\\n0 the lack of opposing viewpoints soon grows tiresome -- the film feels more like a series of toasts at a testimonial dinner than a documentary .\\n0 wait for video -- and then do n't rent it .\\n0 remember when bond had more glamour than clamor ?\\n0 -lrb- i -rrb- f you 've been to more than one indie flick in your life , chances are you 've already seen this kind of thing .\\n1 excellent acting and direction .\\n1 a tender and touching drama , based on the true story of a troubled african-american 's quest to come to terms with his origins , reveals the yearning we all have in our hearts for acceptance within the family circle .\\n1 a very funny movie .\\n1 ranks among willams ' best screen work .\\n1 you can feel the heat that ignites this gripping tale , and the humor and humanity that root it in feeling .\\n1 this may not have the dramatic gut-wrenching impact of other holocaust films , but it 's a compelling story , mainly because of the way it 's told by the people who were there .\\n0 these spiders can outrun a motorcycle and wrap a person in a sticky cocoon in seconds , but they fall short of being interesting or entertaining .\\n1 it 's a terrific american sports movie and dennis quaid is its athletic heart .\\n0 there are weird resonances between actor and role here , and they 're not exactly flattering .\\n0 the fight scenes are fun , but it grows tedious .\\n0 considering the harsh locations and demanding stunts , this must have been a difficult shoot , but the movie proves rough going for the audience as well .\\n1 an idealistic love story that brings out the latent 15-year-old romantic in everyone .\\n1 what kids will discover is a new collectible .\\n0 could the whole plan here have been to produce something that makes fatal attraction look like a classic by comparison ?\\n0 even die-hard fans of japanese animation ... will find this one a challenge .\\n1 it 's a brave attempt to tap into the heartbeat of the world , a salute to the universal language of rhythm and a zippy sampling of sounds .\\n1 ford deserves to be remembered at oscar time for crafting this wonderful portrait of a conflicted soldier .\\n1 that rara avis : the intelligent romantic comedy with actual ideas on its mind .\\n0 could the country bears really be as bad as its trailers ?\\n0 while mcfarlane 's animation lifts the film firmly above the level of other coming-of-age films ... it 's also so jarring that it 's hard to get back into the boys ' story .\\n0 when -lrb- de palma 's -rrb- bad , he 's really bad , and femme fatale ranks with the worst he has done .\\n1 behind the snow games and lovable siberian huskies -lrb- plus one sheep dog -rrb- , the picture hosts a parka-wrapped dose of heart .\\n1 a captivating cross-cultural comedy of manners .\\n1 hawke draws out the best from his large cast in beautifully articulated portrayals that are subtle and so expressive they can sustain the poetic flights in burdette 's dialogue .\\n1 a deceivingly simple film , one that grows in power in retrospect .\\n1 dolgin and franco fashion a fascinating portrait of a vietnamese-born youngster who eagerly and easily assimilated as an all-american girl with a brand new name in southern tennessee .\\n1 look , this is a terrific flick replete with dazzling camera-work , dancing and music .\\n1 presents an astute appraisal of middle american musical torpor and the desperate struggle to escape it .\\n0 mocking them now is an exercise in pointlessness .\\n1 this is how you use special effects .\\n0 like its two predecessors , 1983 's koyaanisqatsi and 1988 's powaqqatsi , the cinematic collage naqoyqatsi could be the most navel-gazing film ever .\\n1 what 's most striking about this largely celebratory film ... is the sense of isolation that permeates these bastions of individuality in an ikea world .\\n1 he 's super spy !\\n0 though the book runs only about 300 pages , it is so densely packed ... that even an ambitious adaptation and elaborate production like mr. schepisi 's seems skimpy and unclear .\\n1 i do n't know precisely what to make of steven soderbergh 's full frontal , though that did n't stop me from enjoying much of it .\\n0 has the feel of an unedited personal journal .\\n0 the film takes too long getting to the good stuff , then takes too long figuring out what to do next .\\n1 skip work to see it at the first opportunity .\\n0 ecks this one off your must-see list .\\n1 gosling provides an amazing performance that dwarfs everything else in the film .\\n0 the movie has very little to offer besides unintentional laughs .\\n0 ostensibly celebrates middle-aged girl power , even as it presents friendship between women as pathetic , dysfunctional and destructive .\\n1 the movie will reach far beyond its core demographic .\\n1 so many documentaries like this presuppose religious bigotry or zealous nuttiness of its antagonists , but family fundamentals displays a rare gift for unflinching impartiality .\\n1 smart science fiction for grown-ups , with only a few false steps along the way .\\n1 the movie is one of the best examples of artful large format filmmaking you are likely to see anytime soon .\\n1 merely as a technical , logistical feat , russian ark marks a cinematic milestone .\\n1 but if it is indeed a duty of art to reflect life , than leigh has created a masterful piece of artistry right here .\\n0 not a movie but a live-action agitprop cartoon so shameless and coarse , it 's almost funny .\\n0 murder and mayhem of this sort quickly becomes monotonous .\\n1 even with all those rough edges safely sanded down , the american insomnia is still pretty darned good .\\n0 the reason we keep seeing the same movie with roughly the same people every year is because so many of us keep going and then , out of embarrassment or stupidity , not warning anyone .\\n0 there is not an ounce of honesty in the entire production .\\n0 it 's getting harder and harder to ignore the fact that hollywood is n't laughing with us , folks .\\n0 gee , a second assassin shot kennedy ?\\n0 birot 's directorial debut -lrb- she co-wrote the script with christophe honoré -rrb- is n't so much bad as it is bland .\\n1 as bundy , michael reilly burke -lrb- octopus 2 : river of fear -rrb- has just the right amount of charisma and menace .\\n0 it feels like a community theater production of a great broadway play : even at its best , it will never hold a candle to the original .\\n0 scarlet diva has a voyeuristic tug , but all in all it 's a lot less sensational than it wants to be .\\n0 b. -rrb- that sure is pathetic !\\n0 this pep-talk for faith , hope and charity does little to offend , but if saccharine earnestness were a crime , the film 's producers would be in the clink for life .\\n1 the director , steven shainberg , has succeeded by focusing intently on his characters , making them quirky individuals rather than figures of fun .\\n1 it 's a decent glimpse into a time period , and an outcast , that is no longer accessible , but it does n't necessarily shed more light on its subject than the popular predecessor .\\n0 -lrb- u -rrb- nrelentingly stupid .\\n0 the film makes a tragic error by going on for too long , trying to mirror every subsequent event in chinese history : war , revolution , communism , etc. .\\n1 compelling as it is exotic , fast

quentin tarantino , part guy ritchie , and part 1960s spy spoof , it 's all bad .\\n1 hands down the year 's most thought-provoking film .\\n0 the furious coherence that -lrb- deniro -rrb- brings to this part only underscores the fuzzy sentimentality of the movie itself , which feels , as it plods toward the end , less like a movie than like the filmed reading of a script in need of polishing .\\n0 you might not buy the ideas .\\n0 looks like a high school film project completed the day before it was due .\\n1 as shaky as the plot is , kaufman 's script is still memorable for some great

clever but veers into overkill .\\n0 there 's nothing provocative about this film save for the ways in which it studiously avoids provoking thought .\\n1 a gentle blend of present day testimonials , surviving footage of burstein and his family performing , historical archives , and telling stills .\\n0 -lrb- it 's -rrb- a prison soccer movie starring charismatic tough guy vinnie jones , but it

.\\n1 the hours makes you examine your own life in much the same way its characters do , and the experience is profound .\\n1 hugh grant and sandra bullock are two such likeable actors .\\n1 in its ragged , cheap and unassuming way , the movie works .\\n0 while the film misfires at every level , the biggest downside is the paucity of laughter in what 's supposed to be a comedy .\\n1 i love the way that it took chances and really asks you to take these great leaps of faith and pays off .\\n0 lacks heart , depth and , most of all , purpose .\\n0 oedekerk wrote patch adams , for which he should not be forgiven .\\n0 with a story as bizarre and mysterious as this , you do n't want to be worrying about whether the ineffectual broomfield is going to have the courage to knock on that door .\\n0 marries the amateurishness of the blair witch project with the illogic of series 7 : the contenders to create a completely crass and forgettable movie .\\n1 the movie 's eventual success should be credited to dennis quaid , in fighting trim shape as an athlete as well as an actor\\n0 the actors do n't inhabit their roles -- they 're trapped by them , forced to change behavior in bizarre

vile and tacky are the two best adjectives to describe ghost ship .\\n1 bow 's best moments are when he 's getting busy on the basketball court because that 's when he really scores .\\n0 a movie that

fiftysomething leading ladies , but fails loudly in execution .\\n0 undone by its overly complicated and derivative screenplay , the glacier-paced direction and the stereotypical characters .\\n0 some , like ballistic , arrive stillborn ... looking like the beaten , well-worn video box cover of seven years into the future .\\n0 the sort of movie that gives tastelessness a bad rap .\\n0 this time out , -lrb- sade -rrb- is an unsettlingly familiar figure -- in turns loyal and deceitful , responsible and reckless , idealistically selfless and coldly self-interested .\\n1 a pleasant romantic comedy .\\n0 the director 's twitchy sketchbook style and adroit perspective shifts grow wearisome amid leaden pacing and indifferent craftsmanship -lrb- most notably wretched sound design -rrb- .\\n1 must be seen to be believed .\\n1 ... a poignant and powerful narrative that reveals that reading writing and arithmetic are not the only subjects to learn in life .\\n1 this is a film brimming with detail and nuance and one that speaks volumes about the ability of the human spirit to find solace in events that could easily crush it forever .\\n0 birot is a competent enough filmmaker , but her story has nothing fresh or very exciting about it .\\n1 it 's a minor comedy that tries to balance sweetness with coarseness , while it paints a sad picture of the singles scene .\\n0 it delivers some chills and sustained unease , but flounders in its quest for deeper meaning .\\n0 shot perhaps ` artistically ' with handheld cameras and apparently no movie lights by joaquin baca-asay , the low-budget production swings annoyingly between vertigo and opacity .\\n0 it 's painful .\\n0 a simple , sometimes maddeningly slow film that has just enough charm and good acting to make it interesting , but is ultimately pulled under by the pacing and lack of creativity within .\\n1 as blunt as it is in depicting child abuse , el bola is a movie steeped in an ambiguity that lends its conflicts a symbolic resonance .\\n1 morton is , as usual , brilliant .\\n0 the picture is a primer on what happens when lack of know-how mixes with lack of give-a-damn .\\n0 ... a weak , manipulative , pencil-thin story that is miraculously able to entertain anyway .\\n1 what could have become just another cautionary fable is allowed to play out as a clever , charming tale -- as pleasantly in its

cast to clown in situations that are n't funny .\\n0 it wo n't be long before you 'll spy i spy at a video store near you .\\n1 an engaging overview of johnson 's eccentric career .\\n0 proof that a thriller can be sleekly shot , expertly cast , paced with crisp professionalism ... and still be a letdown if its twists and turns hold no more surprise than yesterday 's weather report .\\n1 the movie stays afloat thanks to its hallucinatory production design .\\n0 this goofy gangster yarn never really elevates itself from being yet another earnestly generic crime-busting comic vehicle -- a well-intentioned remake that shows some spunk and promise but fails to register as anything distinctive or daring\\n0 sorry , charlie\\n1 it 's a hoot and a half , and a great way for the american people to see what a candidate is like when he 's not giving the same 15-cent stump speech .\\n1 in scope , ambition and accomplishment , children of the century ... takes kurys ' career to a whole new level .\\n0 the sad thing about knockaround guys is its lame aspiration for grasping the coolness vibes when in fact the film is n't as flippant or slick as it thinks it is .\\n0 the more kevin costner rests on his pretty-boy laurels , the public is , regrettably , going to have tepid films like dragonfly tossed at them .\\n0 ... -lrb- a -rrb- strained comedy that jettisons all opportunities for rock to make his mark by serving up the usual chaotic nonsense .\\n0 blessed with immense physical prowess he may well be , but ahola is simply not an actor .\\n0 another big , dumb action movie in the vein of xxx , the transporter is riddled with plot holes big enough for its titular hero to drive his sleek black bmw through .\\n0 nothing denis has made before , like beau travil and nenette et boni , could prepare us for this gory , perverted , sex-soaked riff on the cannibal genre .\\n1 led by griffin 's smartly nuanced performance and enthusiasm , the cast has a lot of fun with the material .\\n0 it 's frustrating to see these guys -- who are obviously pretty clever -- waste their talent on parodies of things they probably thought were funniest when they were high .\\n0 i watched the brainless insanity of no such thing with mounting disbelief .\\n0 the angst-ridden , affluent slacker characters are more grating than engaging .\\n1 he just wants them to be part of the action , the wallpaper of his chosen reality .\\n1 the movie 's ripe , enrapturing beauty will tempt those willing to probe its inscrutable mysteries .\\n0 like so many other allegedly scary movies , it gets so tangled up in the twist that it chokes the energy right out of the very audience it seeks to frighten .\\n1 is n't it great ?\\n1 enormously likable , partly because it is aware of its own grasp of the absurd .\\n1 this is as powerful a set of evidence as you 'll ever find of why art matters , and how it can resonate far beyond museum walls and through to the most painfully marginal lives .\\n0 guillen rarely gets beneath the surface of things .\\n1 the film is exhilarating to watch because sandler , liberated from the constraints of formula , reveals unexpected depths as an actor .\\n1 ranging from funny to shattering and featuring some of the year 's best acting , personal velocity gathers plenty of dramatic momentum .\\n1 the film is faithful to what one presumes are the book 's twin premises -- that we become who we are on the backs of our parents , but we have no idea who they were at our age ; and that time is a fleeting and precious commodity no matter how old you are .\\n0 some decent actors inflict big damage upon their reputations .\\n0 human nature talks the talk , but it fails to walk the silly walk that distinguishes the merely quirky from the surreal

'll crack .\\n1 an exceedingly clever piece of cinema .\\n1 lead provocatuers testud and parmentier give superlative performances\\n0 apallingly absurd ... the chemistry or lack thereof between newton

quickly , the film falls into a soothing formula of brotherly conflict and reconciliation .\\n0 when the painted backdrops in a movie are more alive than its characters , you know you 're in trouble .\\n0 this overproduced and generally disappointing effort is n't likely to rouse the rush hour crowd .\\n1 having never been a huge fan of dickens ' 800-page novel , it surprised me how much pleasure i had watching mcgrath 's version .\\n0 the noble tradition of men in drag hits an all-time low in sorority boys , whose makers apparently believe that women 's clothing can cover up any deficiency in acting , writing or direction .\\n0 if you collected all the moments of coherent dialogue , they still would n't add up to the time required to boil a four - minute egg .\\n0 the problem with this film is that it 's forced to make its characters idiots in order to advance the plot .\\n0 it 's disappointing when filmmakers throw a few big-name actors and cameos at a hokey script .\\n0 the story is naturally poignant , but first-time screenwriter paul pender overloads it with sugary bits of business .\\n0 so lazy and slipshod it confuses the mere flashing of kinky soft-core imagery with naughty fun .\\n1 a love for films shines through each frame and the era is recreated with obvious affection , scored to perfection with some tasty boogaloo beats .\\n0 i tried to read the time on my watch .\\n0 writer\\\\/director john mckay ignites some charming chemistry between kate and jed but , when he veers into sodden melodrama , punctuated by violins , it 's disastrous and kate 's jealous

incendiary , deeply thought-provoking look at one of the most peculiar -lrb- and peculiarly venomous -rrb- bigotries in our increasingly frightening theocracy\\n1 lee jeong-hyang tells it so lovingly and films it so beautifully that i could n't help being captivated by it .\\n1 the episodic film makes valid points about the depersonalization of modern life .\\n1 it 's almost impossible not to be moved by the movie 's depiction of sacrifice and its stirring epilogue in post-soviet russia .\\n1 though the film 's scenario is certainly not earthshaking , this depiction of fluctuating female sexuality has two winning lead performances and charm to spare .\\n1 kinnear gives a tremendous performance .\\n1 perhaps no picture ever made has more literally showed that the road to hell is paved

spunk are often infectious .\\n1 claude miller airs out a tight plot with an easy pace and a focus on character drama over crime-film complications .\\n0 to imagine the life of harry potter as a martial arts adventure told by a lobotomized woody allen is to have some idea of the fate that lies in store for moviegoers lured to the mediocrity that is kung pow : enter the fist .\\n1 the film is

those assigned to protect us from same , we need every bit of sympathy the cons can muster ; this time , there is n't much .\\n1 `` antwone fisher '' is an earnest , by-the-numbers effort by washington .\\n1 succeeds in providing a disquiet world the long-dreaded completion of the police academy series .\\n0 if you 're not the target demographic ... this movie is one long chick-flick slog .\\n0 the actors are forced to grapple with hazy motivations that never come into focus .\\n0 the best you can say about it is it 's so uninspired , it barely gives one pause when considering some of the other dreck out there right now .\\n1 by presenting an impossible romance in an impossible world , pumpkin dares us to say why either is impossible -- which forces us to confront what 's possible and what we might do to make it so .\\n1 after making several adaptations of other writers ' work , armenian-canadian director atom egoyan broached an original treatment of a deeply personal subject .\\n0 all the necessary exposition prevents the picture from rising above your generic sand 'n' sandal adventure .\\n0 audiences will find no mention of political prisoners or persecutions that might paint the castro regime in less than saintly tones .\\n0 ... just a big mess of a movie , full of images and events , but no tension or surprise .\\n0 i kept wishing i was watching a documentary about the wartime navajos and what they accomplished instead of all this specious hollywood hoo-ha .\\n1 the film delivers not just the full assault of reno 's immense wit and insight , but a time travel back to what it felt like during those unforgettably uncertain days .\\n0 one groan-inducing familiarity begets another .\\n0 john mctiernan 's botched remake may be subtler than norman jewison 's 1975 ultraviolent futuristic corporate-sports saga .\\n1 an earnest , heartrending look at the divide between religious fundamentalists and their gay relatives .\\n1 a pleasurably jacked-up piece of action moviemaking .\\n0 but an unwillingness to explore beyond the surfaces of her characters prevents nettelbeck 's film from coming together .\\n0 too clunky and too busy ribbing itself to be truly entertaining .\\n0 the enormous comic potential of an oafish idiot impersonating an aristocrat remains sadly unrealized .\\n1 everywhere the camera looks there is something worth seeing .\\n1 the best thing the film does is to show us not only what that mind looks like , but how the creative process itself operates .\\n1 a modest pleasure that accomplishes its goals with ease and confidence .\\n1 one of the best examples of how to treat a subject , you 're not fully aware is being examined , much like a photo of yourself you did n't know was being taken .\\n1 mixes likeable personalities , inventive photography and cutting , and wall-to-wall toe-tapping music to paint a picture of a subculture that is at once exhilarating , silly , perverse , hopeful and always fun .\\n0 but i was n't .\\n1 though of particular interest to students and enthusiast of international dance and world music , the film is designed to make viewers of all ages , cultural backgrounds and rhythmic ability want to get up and dance .\\n0 a silly , self-indulgent film about a silly , self-indulgent filmmaker .\\n1 most impressive , though , is the film 's open-ended finale that refuses to entirely close its characters ' emotional wounds .\\n0 it 's a movie forged in the fires of chick flick hell .\\n0 it 's fairly self-aware in its dumbness .\\n1 credit must be given to harland williams , michael rosenbaum and barry watson , who inject far more good-natured spirit and talent into this project than it deserves\\n0 the piano teacher is the sort of movie that discourages american audiences from ever wanting to see another foreign film .\\n0 watching it is rather like viewing a long soap opera in which only the first episode was any good .\\n1 a simmering psychological drama in which the bursts of sudden violence are all the more startling for the slow buildup that has preceded them .\\n1 there 's a disreputable air about the whole thing , and that 's what makes it irresistible .\\n1 a pleasant ramble through the sort of idoosyncratic terrain that errol morris has often dealt with ... it does possess a loose , lackadaisical charm .\\n1 this is one of the most visually stunning and thematically moving epics in recent memory , and in spite of numerous minor flaws , scorsese 's best in more than a decade .\\n1 for a good chunk of its running time , trapped is an effective and claustrophobic thriller .\\n1 full frontal is the antidote for soderbergh fans who think he 's gone too commercial since his two oscar nominated films in 2000\\n0 even the imaginative gore ca n't hide the musty scent of todd farmer 's screenplay , which is a simple retread of the 1979 alien , with a plucky heroine battling a monster loose in a spaceship .\\n1 as if to prove a female director can make a movie with no soft edges , kathryn bigelow offers no sugar-coating or interludes of lightness .\\n0 the filmmakers juggle and juxtapose three story lines but fail to come up with one cogent point , unless it 's that life stinks , especially for sensitive married women who really love other women .\\n0 made by jackasses for jackasses .\\n0 if melville is creatively a great whale , this film is canned tuna .\\n0 pretentious editing ruins a potentially terrific flick .\\n0 topkapi this is not .\\n1 but he somehow pulls it off .\\n0 bartleby is a one-joke movie , and a bad joke at that .\\n1 it is risky , intelligent , romantic and rapturous from start to finish .\\n1 a worthwhile way to spend two hours .\\n0 never again swings between false sentiment and unfunny madcap comedy and , along the way , expects the audience to invest in the central relationship as some kind of marriage of true minds .\\n1 two generations within one family test boundaries in this intelligent and restrained coming-of-age drama .\\n1 -lrb- gai -rrb- comes closer to any actress i can remember to personifying independence in its purest and , yes , most intimidating form .\\n1 a broadly played , lowbrow comedy in which the cast delivers mildly amusing performances and no farm animals were injured by any of the gags .\\n0 filmmakers have to dig deep to sink this low .\\n0 then lower them a bit more .\\n0 i cry for i spy -- or i would if this latest and laziest imaginable of all vintage-tv spinoffs were capable of engendering an emotional response of any kind .\\n0 a very bad sign .\\n0 well , it does go on forever .\\n0 this is n't just the cliffsnotes version of nicholas nickleby , it 's the cliffsnotes with pages missing .\\n1 it 's all very cute , though not terribly funny if you 're more than six years old .\\n0 fortunately for all involved , this movie is likely to disappear as quickly as an ice cube thrown into a pot of boiling water .\\n0 guided more by intellect than heart , his story flattens instead of sharpens .\\n1 it 's an old story , but a lively script , sharp acting and partially animated interludes make just a kiss seem minty fresh .\\n0 it 's the kind of movie you ca n't quite recommend because it is all windup and not much of a pitch , yet you ca n't bring yourself to dislike it .\\n1 an excellent romp that boasts both a heart and a mind .\\n0 john leguizamo may be a dramatic actor -- just not in this movie .\\n1 tender yet lacerating and darkly funny fable .\\n1 this delicately observed story , deeply felt and masterfully stylized , is a triumph for its maverick director .\\n0 a generation x artifact , capturing a brief era of insanity in the sports arena that surely can not last .\\n0 the film 's center will not hold .\\n1 it is far from the worst , thanks to the topical issues it raises , the performances of stewart and hardy , and that essential feature -- a decent full-on space battle .\\n0 it 's also stupider .\\n0 none of these characters resembles anyone you 've ever met in real life , unless you happen to know annoyingly self-involved people who speak in glib sentences that could have only come from the pen of a screenwriter .\\n1 sensitive , insightful and beautifully rendered film .\\n1 a bowel-curdling , heart-stopping recipe for terror .\\n0 although based on a real-life person , john , in the movie , is a rather dull person to be stuck with for two hours .\\n0 ` abandon all hope , ye who enter here ' ... you should definitely let dante 's gloomy words be your guide .\\n0 an ultra-low-budget indie debut that smacks more of good intentions than talent .\\n0 there 's not enough to sustain the comedy .\\n0 fairly successful at faking some pretty cool stunts but a complete failure at trying to create some pretty cool characters .\\n0 the film is really not so much bad as bland .\\n0 schmaltzy and unfunny , adam sandler 's cartoon about hanukkah is numbingly bad , little nicky bad , 10 worst list bad .\\n1 a vivid cinematic portrait .\\n1 it 's a refreshing change from the self-interest and paranoia that shape most american representations of castro .\\n1 the bourne identity is what summer screen escapism used to be in the decades when it was geared more to grownups .\\n1 it could change america , not only because it is full of necessary discussion points , but because it is so accessible that it makes complex politics understandable to viewers looking for nothing but energetic entertainment .\\n0 frenetic but not really funny .\\n1 sandra nettelbeck beautifully orchestrates the transformation of the chilly , neurotic , and self-absorbed martha as her heart begins to open .\\n0 it 's a film that hinges on its casting , and glover really does n't fit the part .\\n0 ritchie 's treatment of the class reversal is majorly ham-fisted , from the repetitive manifestos that keep getting thrown in people 's faces to the fact amber is such a joke .\\n1 this is such a dazzlingly self-assured directorial debut that it 's hard to know what to praise first .\\n0 apparently kissing leads to suicide attempts and tragic deaths .\\n1 andy garcia enjoys one of his richest roles in years and mick jagger gives his best movie performance since , well , performance .\\n1 -lrb- anderson -rrb- uses a hit-or-miss aesthetic that hits often enough to keep the film entertaining even if none of it makes a lick of sense .\\n1 this is a startling film that gives you a fascinating , albeit depressing view of iranian rural life close to the iraqi border .\\n0 this film looks like it was produced in 1954 , shelved for 48 years , and repackaged for a 2002 audience .\\n1 dazzling and sugar-sweet , a blast of shallow magnificence that only sex , scandal , and a chorus line of dangerous damsels can deliver .\\n1 from the big giant titles of the opening credits to elmer bernstein 's perfectly melodic score , haynes gets just about everything right .\\n0 watching it is rather like an overlong visit from a large group of your relatives .\\n1 as the story moves inexorably through its seven day timeframe , the picture becomes increasingly mesmerizing .\\n1 working from elliott 's memoir , rohmer fashions the sort of delicate , articulate character - and - relationship study he 's favored for decades .\\n1 watching scarlet diva , one is poised for titillation , raw insight or both .\\n0 intended to be a comedy about relationships , this wretched work falls flat in just about every conceivable area .\\n1 -lrb- a -rrb- rare , beautiful film .\\n0 ... the film falls back on the same old formula of teen sex , outrageous pranks and scenes designed to push the envelope of bad taste for laughs .\\n0 suffocated at conception by its munchausen-by-proxy mum .\\n1 while not all transitions to adulthood are so fraught , there 's much truth and no small amount of poetry in girls ca n't swim .\\n0 opens as promising as any war\\\\/adventure film you 'll ever see and dissolves into a routine courtroom drama , better suited for a movie titled `` glory : a soldier 's story . ''\\n1 it 's -lrb- ricci 's -rrb- best work yet , this girl-woman who sincerely believes she can thwart the world 's misery with blind good will .\\n0 this may be the dumbest , sketchiest movie on record about an aspiring writer 's coming-of-age .\\n1 evokes a little of the fear that parents have for the possible futures of their children -- and the sometimes bad choices mothers and fathers make in the interests of doing them good .\\n1 as expected , sayles ' smart wordplay and clever plot contrivances are as sharp as ever , though they may be overshadowed by some strong performances .\\n0 too bad the former murphy brown does n't pop reese back .\\n1 it 's predictable , but it jumps through the expected hoops with style and even some depth .\\n1 george clooney proves he 's quite a talented director and sam rockwell shows us he 's a world-class actor with confessions of a dangerous mind .\\n1 ... mesmerizing , an eye-opening tour of modern beijing culture in a journey of rebellion , retreat into oblivion and return .\\n1 the film is painfully authentic , and the performances of the young players are utterly convincing .\\n1 a potent allegorical love story .\\n1 provides an intriguing window into the imagination and hermetic analysis of todd solondz .\\n1 it 's endearing to hear madame d. refer to her husband as ` jackie ' -- and he does make for excellent company , not least as a self-conscious performer .\\n0 so few movies explore religion that it 's disappointing to see one reduce it to an idea that fits in a sampler .\\n0 needless to say , the dramatics that follow are utter hooey .\\n0 calling this movie brainless would be paying it a compliment : it 's more like entertainment for trolls .\\n1 it is a kickass , dense sci-fi action thriller hybrid that delivers and then some .\\n1 it 's a movie -- and an album -- you wo n't want to miss .\\n0 now , if it only had a brain .\\n1 a budget affair that exposes the generally sad existence of the bedouins while providing a precious twinkle of insight into their lives .\\n0 like a south-of-the-border melrose place .\\n1 it 's a bittersweet and lyrical mix of elements .\\n0 this series should have died long ago , but they keep bringing it back another day as punishment for paying money to see the last james bond movie .\\n1 fans of behan 's work and of irish movies in general will be rewarded by borstal boy .\\n1 everytime you think undercover brother has run out of steam , it finds a new way to surprise and amuse .\\n1 a startling and fresh examination of how the bike still remains an ambiguous icon in chinese society .\\n1 although it 's a bit smug and repetitive , this documentary engages your brain in a way few current films do .\\n0 watching haneke 's film is , aptly enough , a challenge and a punishment .\\n0 once the audience figure out what 's being said , the filmmaker 's relative passivity will make it tough for them to really care .\\n0 but like bruce springsteen 's gone-to-pot asbury park , new jersey , this sad-sack waste of a movie is a city of ruins .\\n1 stay clear of reminding yourself that it 's a `` true story '' and you 're likely to have one helluva time at the movies .\\n0 so routine , familiar and predictable , it raises the possibility that it wrote itself as a newly automated final draft computer program .\\n1 in the process , they demonstrate that there 's still a lot of life in hong kong cinema .\\n1 though mama takes a bit too long to find its rhythm and a third-act plot development is somewhat melodramatic , its ribald humor and touching nostalgia are sure to please anyone in search of a jules and jim for the new millennium .\\n1 it 's absolutely spooky how lillard channels the shagster right down to the original casey kasem-furnished voice .\\n0 like those to rome , all roads in the banger sisters inevitably lead to a joke about hawn 's breasts , which constantly threaten to upstage the woman sporting them .\\n1 a provocative movie about loss , anger , greed , jealousy , sickness and love .\\n1 its scenes and sensibility are all more than familiar , but it exudes a kind of nostalgic spy-movie charm and , at the same time , is so fresh and free of the usual thriller nonsense that it all seems to be happening for the first time .\\n0 a soggy , shapeless mess ... just a dumb excuse for a waterlogged equivalent of a haunted-house movie .\\n0 there 's an audience for it , but it could have been funnier and more innocent .\\n1 achieves a sort of filmic epiphany that revels in the true potential of the medium .\\n1 if you sometimes like to go to the movies to have fun , wasabi is a good place to start .\\n0 but hard-to-believe plot twists force the movie off track in its final half hour .\\n1 ... always remains movingly genuine .\\n0 maybe it 's the star power of the cast or the redundant messages , but something aboul `` full frontal '' seems , well , contrived .\\n0 the situations and

childhood nostalgia slumber unmolested .\\n1 -lrb- a -rrb- superbly controlled , passionate adaptation of graham greene 's 1955 novel .\\n1 a refreshingly honest and ultimately touching tale of the sort of people usually ignored in contemporary american film .\\n0 no , it 's the repetition of said behavior , and so children of the century is more mindless love than mad , more grating and boring than anything else .\\n1 a comic gem with some serious sparkles .\\n0 desperately unfunny when it tries to makes us laugh and desperately unsuspenseful when it tries to make us jump out of our seats .\\n1 the movie is a blast of educational energy , as bouncy animation and catchy songs escort you through the entire 85 minutes .\\n0 a bravura exercise in emptiness .\\n1 this concoction , so bizarre to the adult mind , is actually a charming triumph where its intended under-12 audience is concerned .\\n0 this one 's weaker than most .\\n1 a lighthearted , feel-good film that embraces the

borrowed plot points and situations .\\n0 a mawkish , implausible platonic romance that makes chaplin 's city lights seem dispassionate by comparison .\\n1 rich in detail , gorgeously shot and beautifully acted , les destinees is , in its quiet , epic way , daring , inventive and refreshingly unusual .\\n1 an offbeat , sometimes gross and surprisingly appealing animated film about the true meaning of the holidays .\\n1 another great ` what you do n't see ' is much more terrifying than what you do see thriller , coupled with some arresting effects , incandescent tones and stupendous performances\\n0 if you pitch your expectations at an all time low , you could do worse than this oddly cheerful -- but not particularly funny -- body-switching farce .\\n0 feels less like it 's about teenagers , than it was written by teenagers .\\n0 going to the website may be just as fun -lrb- and scary -rrb- as going to the film .\\n0 is this progress ?\\n0 for a shoot - 'em - up , ballistic is oddly lifeless .\\n1 one of the best of the year .\\n1 there are moments it can be heart-rending in an honest and unaffected -lrb- and gentle -rrb- way .\\n0 credibility levels are low and character development a non-starter .\\n0 looks awfully like one long tourist spot for a mississippi that may never have existed outside of a scriptwriter 's imagination .\\n1 a solidly seaworthy chiller .\\n0 when it comes to entertainment , children deserve better than pokemon 4ever .\\n0 if this is the resurrection of the halloween franchise , it would have been better off dead .\\n0 still , i thought it could have been more .\\n1 a recent favourite at sundance , this white-trash satire will inspire the affection of even those unlucky people who never owned a cassette of def leppard 's pyromania .\\n1 though it is by no means his best work , laissez-passer is a distinguished and distinctive effort by a bona-fide master , a fascinating film replete with rewards to be had by all willing to make the effort to reap them .\\n0 like mike does n't win any points for originality .\\n1 ms. fulford-wierzbicki is almost spooky in her sulky , calculating lolita turn .\\n1 the movie has a soft , percolating magic , a deadpan suspense .\\n1 legendary irish writer brendan behan 's memoir , borstal boy , has been given a loving screen transferral .\\n1 at times funny and at other times candidly revealing , it 's an intriguing look at two performers who put themselves out there because they love what they do .\\n0 it 's often faintly amusing , but the problems of the characters never become important to us , and the story never takes hold .\\n1 it 's amazingly perceptive in its subtle , supportive but unsentimental look at the marks family .\\n1 it uses an old-time formula , it 's not terribly original and it 's rather messy -- but you just have to love the big , dumb , happy movie my big fat greek wedding .\\n1 if you liked such movies as notting hill , four weddings and a funeral , bridget jones ' diary or high fidelity , then you wo n't want to miss about a boy .\\n1 katz uses archival footage , horrifying documents of lynchings , still photographs and charming old reel-to-reel recordings of meeropol entertaining his children to create his song history , but most powerful of all is the song itself\\n0 -lrb- it 's -rrb- difficult to get beyond the overall blandness of american chai , despite its likable performances and refreshingly naive point of view .\\n1 a worthy tribute to a great humanitarian and her vibrant ` co-stars . '\\n0 but as a movie , it 's a humorless , disjointed mess .\\n1 what 's next ?\\n0 frustratingly , dridi tells us nothing about el gallo other than what emerges through his music .\\n0 showtime is closer to slowtime .\\n1 tim allen is great in his role but never hogs the scenes from his fellow cast , as there are plenty of laughs and good lines for everyone in this comedy .\\n1 britney has been delivered to the big screen safe and sound , the way we like our 20-year-old superstar girls to travel on the fame freeway .\\n0 has little on its mind aside from scoring points with drag gags .\\n1 an enchanting spectacular for potter fans anxious to ride the hogwarts express toward a new year of magic and mischief .\\n1 it 's a nicely detailed world of pawns , bishops and kings , of wagers in dingy backrooms or pristine forests .\\n0 a real clunker .\\n0 the film seems a dead weight .\\n1 the voices are fine as well .\\n1 it turns out to be a cut above the norm , thanks to some clever writing and sprightly acting .\\n0 an awkward and indigestible movie .\\n0 showtime is one of the hapless victims of the arrogant `` if we put together a wry white man and a chatty black man and give

cliches whose lives are never fully explored .\\n0 as your relatives swap one mundane story after another , you begin to wonder if they are ever going to depart .\\n1 wasabi is slight fare indeed , with the entire project having the feel of something tossed off quickly -lrb- like one of hubert 's punches -rrb- , but it should go down smoothly enough with popcorn .\\n0 the film equivalent of a toy chest whose contents get scattered over the course of 80 minutes .\\n1 go see it and enjoy .\\n0 her film is unrelentingly claustrophobic and unpleasant .\\n1 chicago is sophisticated , brash , sardonic , completely joyful in its execution .\\n0 obstacles are too easily overcome and there is n't much in the way of character development in the script .\\n0 a hysterical yet humorless disquisition on the thin line between sucking face and literally sucking face .\\n0 the cold and dreary weather is a perfect metaphor for the movie itself , which contains few laughs and not much drama .\\n1 on its own cinematic terms , it successfully showcases the passions of both the director and novelist byatt .\\n0 pryor lite , with half the demons , half the daring , much less talent , many fewer laughs .\\n1 this is a terrific character study , a probe into the life of a complex man .\\n1 a romantic comedy , yes , but one with characters who think and talk about their goals , and are working on hard decisions .\\n0 any film featuring young children threatened by a terrorist bomb can no longer pass as mere entertainment .\\n0 what parents will suspect is that they 're watching a 76-minute commercial .\\n0 do n't let your festive spirit go this far .\\n1 eastwood is an icon of moviemaking , one of the best actors , directors and producers around , responsible for some excellent work .\\n1 a historical epic with the courage of its convictions about both scope and detail .\\n0 a thinly veiled excuse for wilson to play his self-deprecating act against murphy 's well-honed prima donna shtick .\\n1 an epic of grandeur and scale that 's been decades gone from the popcorn pushing sound stages of hollywood .\\n0 preposterous and tedious , sonny is spiked with unintentional laughter that , unfortunately , occurs too infrequently to make the film even a guilty pleasure .\\n1 it will delight newcomers to the story and those who know it from bygone days .\\n0 the saturation bombing of reggio 's images and glass ' evocative music ... ultimately leaves viewers with the task of divining meaning .\\n1 as a witness to several greek-american weddings -- but , happily , a victim of none -- i can testify to the comparative accuracy of ms. vardalos ' memories and insights .\\n1 a wonderful character-based comedy .\\n0 k-19 may not hold a lot of water as a submarine epic , but it holds even less when it turns into an elegiacally soggy saving private ryanovich .\\n0 do n't waste your money .\\n0 dreary , highly annoying ... ` some body ' will appeal to no one .\\n0 just when the movie seems confident enough to handle subtlety , it dives into soapy bathos .\\n1 a carefully structured scream of consciousness that is tortured and unsettling -- but unquestionably alive .\\n0 punish the vehicle to adore the star .\\n1 reign of fire may be little more than another platter of reheated aliens , but it 's still pretty tasty .\\n1 thoughtful , even stinging at times , and lots of fun .\\n1 it 's a humble effort , but spiced with wry humor and genuine pathos , especially between morgan and redgrave .\\n0 the editing is chaotic , the photography grainy and badly focused , the writing unintentionally hilarious , the direction unfocused , the performances as wooden .\\n0 the movie feels like it 's going to be great , and it carries on feeling that way for a long time , but takeoff just never happens .\\n1 an uneven but intriguing drama that is part homage and part remake of the italian masterpiece .\\n1 a sweet-natured reconsideration of one of san francisco 's most vital , if least widely recognized , creative fountainheads .\\n0 with spy kids 2 : the island of lost dreams writer\\\\/director\\\\/producer robert rodriguez has cobbled together a film that feels like a sugar high gone awry .\\n0 i found it slow , drab , and bordering on melodramatic .\\n0 -lrb- sen 's -rrb- soap opera-ish approach undermines his good intentions .\\n0 the stories here suffer from the chosen format .\\n1 ... a cute and sometimes side-splittingly funny blend of legally blonde and drop dead gorgeous , starring piper perabo in what could be her breakthrough role .\\n1 offers a breath of the fresh air of true sophistication .\\n1 a pro-fat farce that overcomes much of its excessive moral baggage thanks to two appealing lead performances .\\n0 there is no entry portal in the rules of attraction , and i spent most of the movie feeling depressed by the shallow , selfish , greedy characters .\\n0 at the bottom rung of the series ' entries .\\n1 whatever eyre 's failings as a dramatist , he deserves credit for bringing audiences into this hard and bitter place .\\n1 the spark of special anime magic here is unmistakable and hard to resist .\\n0 despite apparent motives to the contrary , it ends up being , like -lrb- seinfeld 's -rrb- revered tv show , about pretty much nothing .\\n1 mr. parker has brilliantly updated his source and grasped its essence , composing a sorrowful and hilarious tone poem about alienated labor , or an absurdist workplace sitcom .\\n1 the transporter is as lively and as fun as it is unapologetically dumb\\n0 ... too dull to enjoy .\\n1 this is cool , slick stuff , ready to quench the thirst of an audience that misses the summer blockbusters .\\n0 characters wander into predictably treacherous situations even though they should know better .\\n1 with a cast that includes some of the top actors working in independent film , lovely & amazing involves us because it is so incisive , so bleakly amusing about how we go about our lives .\\n0 ... -lrb- like -rrb- channel surfing between the discovery channel and a late-night made-for-cable action movie .\\n0 i hated every minute of it .\\n1 this is a very fine movie -- go see it .\\n1 this is n't my favorite in the series , still i enjoyed it enough to recommend .\\n0 a benign but forgettable sci-fi diversion .\\n0 a bigger holiday

's face you remember at the end .\\n1 it 's a worthwhile tutorial in quantum physics and slash-dash\\n0 the acting is stiff , the story lacks all trace of wit , the sets look like they were borrowed from gilligan 's island -- and the cgi scooby might well be the worst special-effects creation of the year .\\n1 star wars is back in a major way .\\n1 unlike the nauseating fictions peddled by such `

.\\n0 an instant candidate for worst movie of the year .\\n1 a highly intriguing thriller , coupled with some ingenious plot devices and some lavishly built settings . .\\n1 director kapur is a filmmaker with a real flair for epic landscapes and adventure , and this is a better film than his earlier english-language movie , the overpraised elizabeth .\\n1 good actress .\\n0 an overblown

to be neither funny nor provocative - only dull .\\n0 tom green just gives them a bad odor .\\n1 it 's obviously struck a responsive chord with many south koreans , and should work its magic in other parts of the world .\\n1 it has fun being grown up .\\n0 this is a great subject for a movie , but hollywood has squandered the opportunity , using it as a prop for warmed-over melodrama and the kind

ultimately very satisfying .\\n1 remarkably accessible and affecting .\\n0 writhing under dialogue like ` you 're from two different worlds ' and ` tonight the maid is a lie and this , this is who you are , ' this schlock-filled fairy tale hits new depths of unoriginality and predictability .\\n1 this cheery , down-to-earth film is warm with the cozy feeling of relaxing around old friends .\\n0 plays as hollow catharsis , with lots of tears but very little in the way of insights .\\n0 will probably stay in the shadow of its two older , more accessible qatsi siblings .\\n0 credibility sinks into a mire of sentiment .\\n0 director brian levant , who never strays far from his sitcom roots , skates blithely from one implausible situation to another , pausing only to tie up loose ends with more bows than you 'll find on a french poodle .\\n0 it 's hard to tell with all the crashing and banging where the salesmanship ends and the movie begins .\\n1 but it 's emotionally engrossing , too

buddy-comedy .\\n0 one hour photo is an intriguing snapshot of one man and his delusions ; it 's just too bad it does n't have more flashes of insight .\\n0 a one-trick pony whose few t&a bits still

end .\\n1 together , tok and o orchestrate a buoyant , darkly funny dance of death .\\n0 de niro looks bored , murphy recycles murphy , and you mentally add showtime to the pile of hollywood dreck that represents nothing more than the art of the deal .\\n1 the film 's real appeal wo n't be to clooney fans or adventure buffs , but to moviegoers who enjoy thinking about compelling questions with no easy answers .\\n1 guaranteed to move anyone who ever shook , rattled , or rolled .\\n0 unlike his directorial efforts , la femme nikita and the professional , the transporter lacks besson 's perspective as a storyteller .\\n1 at about 95 minutes , treasure planet maintains a brisk pace as it races through the familiar story .\\n0 this limp gender-bender-baller from a first-time director

.\\n0 there has been much puzzlement among critics about what the election symbolizes .\\n1 a masterful film from a master filmmaker , unique in its deceptive grimness , compelling in its fatalist worldview .\\n0 a great idea becomes a not-great movie .\\n1 an inspiring and heart-affecting film about the desperate attempts of vietnamese refugees living in u.s. relocation camps to keep their

the suspense .\\n1 harsh , effective documentary on life in the israeli-occupied palestinian territories .\\n1 steers turns in a snappy screenplay that curls at the edges ; it 's so clever you want to hate it .\\n1 this is what imax was made for : strap on a pair of 3-d goggles , shut out the real world , and take a vicarious voyage to the last frontier -- space .\\n0 but this costly dud is a far cry from either the book or the beloved film .\\n0 the essential problem in orange county is that , having created an unusually vivid set of characters worthy of its strong cast , the film flounders when it comes to giving them something to do .\\n1 ... if you 're in a mind set for goofy comedy , the troopers will entertain with their gross outs , bawdy comedy and head games .\\n1 a work of the utmost subtlety and perception , it marks the outstanding feature debut of writer-director eric byler , who understands the power of the implicit and the virtues of simplicity and economy .\\n1 there are just enough twists in the tale to make it far more satisfying than almost any horror film in recent memory .\\n0 ... hudlin is stuck trying to light a fire with soggy leaves .\\n0 ... a haunting vision , with images that seem more like disturbing hallucinations .\\n0 consists of a plot and jokes done too often by people far more talented than ali g\\n1 a breezy , diverting , conventional , well-acted tale of two men locked in an ongoing game of cat-and-cat .\\n0 the premise is in extremely bad taste , and the film 's supposed insights are so poorly thought-out and substance-free that even a high school senior taking his or her first psychology class could dismiss them .\\n0 imagine a really bad community theater production of west side story without the songs .\\n1 smith profiles five extraordinary american homes , and because the owners seem fully aware of the uses and abuses of fame , it 's a pleasure to enjoy their eccentricities .\\n0 with its hints of a greater intelligence lurking somewhere , the ring makes its stupidity more than obvious .\\n0 an afterschool special without the courage of its convictions .\\n0 uneasy mishmash of styles and genres .\\n0 the period -- swinging london in the time of the mods and the rockers -- gets the once-over once again in gangster no. 1 , but falls apart long before the end .\\n0 earnest falls short of its ideal predecessor largely due to parker 's ill-advised meddling with the timeless source material .\\n1 tailored to entertain !\\n1 in his debut as a film director , denzel washington delivers a lean and engaging work .\\n1 the scope of the silberstein family is large and we grow attached to their lives , full of strength , warmth and vitality . .\\n1 the tone is balanced , reflective and reasonable .\\n1 a real story about real people living their lives concerned about the future of an elderly , mentally handicapped family member .\\n0 if shayamalan wanted to tell a story about a man who loses his faith , why did n't he just do it , instead of using bad sci-fi as window dressing ?\\n1 the way coppola professes his love for movies -- both colorful pop junk and the classics that unequivocally qualify as art -- is giddily entertaining .\\n1 an intimate , good-humored ethnic comedy like numerous others but cuts deeper than expected .\\n1 fans of the animated wildlife adventure show will be in warthog heaven ; others need not necessarily apply .\\n0 the story loses its bite in a last-minute happy ending that 's even less plausible than the rest of the picture .\\n1 it is interesting and fun to see goodall and her chimpanzees on the bigger-than-life screen .\\n1 branagh , in his most forceful non-shakespeare screen performance , grounds even the softest moments in the angry revolt of his wit .\\n1 a droll , well-acted , character-driven comedy with unexpected deposits of feeling .\\n0 the screenplay sabotages the movie 's strengths at almost every juncture .\\n1 a beautiful and haunting examination of the stories we tell ourselves to make sense of the mundane horrors of the world .\\n0 he 'd create a movie better than this .\\n0 my response to the film is best described as lukewarm .\\n1 diane lane shines in unfaithful .\\n0 drags along in a dazed and enervated , drenched-in-the - past numbness .\\n1 thurman and lewis are hilarious throughout .\\n0 extreme oops - oops , ops , no matter how you spell it , it 's still a mistake to go see it .\\n0 an uneven film dealing with too many problems to be taken seriously .\\n1 ana is a vivid , vibrant individual and the movie 's focus upon her makes it successful and accessible .\\n1 ... a polished and relatively sincere piece of escapism .\\n1 as an entertainment , the movie keeps you diverted and best of all , it lightens your wallet without leaving a sting .\\n0 aspires for the piquant but only really achieves a sort of ridiculous sourness .\\n1 chicago is , in many ways , an admirable achievement .\\n1 fisher has bared his soul and confronted his own shortcomings here in a way ... that feels very human and very true to life .\\n1 a charming yet poignant tale of the irrevocable ties that bind .\\n0 or some damn thing .\\n0 its mysteries are transparently obvious , and it 's too slowly paced to be a thriller .\\n0 its gross-out gags and colorful set pieces ... are of course stultifyingly contrived and too stylized by half .\\n1 there is a refreshing absence of cynicism in stuart little 2 -- quite a rarity , even in the family film market .\\n0 creepy but ultimately unsatisfying thriller .\\n1 without resorting to hyperbole , i can state that kissing jessica stein may be the best same-sex romance i have seen .\\n1 a sensitive and expertly acted crowd-pleaser that is n't above a little broad comedy and a few unabashedly sentimental tears .\\n1 the experience of watching blobby old-school cgi animation in this superlarge format is just surreal enough to be diverting .\\n0 ... too slow , too boring , and occasionally annoying .\\n0 this is pretty dicey material .\\n0 the premise is overshadowed by the uberviolence of the clericks as this becomes just another kung-fu sci-fi movie with silly action sequences .\\n1 subversive , meditative , clinical and poetic , the piano teacher is a daring work of genius .\\n1 -lrb- a -rrb- hollywood sheen bedevils the film from the very beginning ... -lrb- but -rrb- lohman 's moist , deeply emotional eyes shine through this bogus veneer ...\\n0 it does n't do the original any particular dishonor , but neither does it exude any charm or personality .\\n1 ... blade ii is more enjoyable than the original .\\n0 there 's suspension of disbelief and then there 's bad screenwriting ... this film packs a wallop of the latter .\\n0 an often-deadly boring , strange reading of a classic whose witty dialogue is treated with a baffling casual approach\\n0 the problem with concept films is that if the concept is a poor one , there 's no saving the movie .\\n0 safe conduct , however ambitious and well-intentioned , fails to hit the entertainment bull 's - eye .\\n0 a film made with as little wit , interest , and professionalism as artistically possible for a slummy hollywood caper flick .\\n0 but here 's the real damn : it is n't funny , either .\\n\""
